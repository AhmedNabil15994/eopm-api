# Extendable Order and Payment Management API
a Laravel-based API for managing orders and payments, with a focus on clean code
principles and extensibility. The system should allow adding new payment gateways with
minimal effort.

By using modular structure <br />
also it depends on Strategy Design Pattern for using different payment gateways.

# Requirements

```
"require": {
  "php": "^8.2",
  "laravel/framework": "^12.0",
  "tymon/jwt-auth": "^2.2"
}
```

# Setup
first run composer install to bring all packages

```
composer install
```

run the following command to install jwt authentication <br />
```
php artisan jwt:secret
```

edit your env file with database connection configuration <br />
then run migrate command
```
php artisan migrate
```

then seed database with ready seeders <br />
```
php artisan db:seed
```

pagination size depends on PER_PAGE please add it inside .env file
```
PER_PAGE=15
```

## - Change Pending Orders

Reserved order products qty could be back to stock if there's no any success payment assigned to order, it depends on the minutes interval you spcified in .env <br /> 
in Conosle/Commands you'll find Command called ChangePendingOrderStatus make sure to schedule it on your cronjob.

```
BACK_PRODUCT_DURATION=15
```

you can run artisan command by using
```
php artisan change:orders
```

# Payment Gateways Extensibility
We'll implement the strategy pattern to allow easy integration of new payment gateways. <br /><br />
first of all you have to add payment gateway configuration inside .env file based on test & live modes <br /><br />
add your payment gateway name in supported payments array inside config/app.php
```
....
'supported_payments' => ['credit_card', 'paypal', 'cash', 'wallet','knet','upayment','your_new_payment_name'],
...

```

Create your payment service class inside App/Services which implements PaymentGatewayInterface. <br />
In App/Services/PaymentGatewayService add new payment declarion inside gateways array in construct function 
```
....
$this->gateways = [
      'your_new_payment_name' => new NewAddedPaymentGateway(),
  ];
...

```
now you can override the following:
## - processPayment function to allow you to do logic for processing new payment gateway. <br />
```
public function processPayment($order)
{
      // Logic for processing new payment
}
```

## - createTransaction function to allow you to associate payments to order using new payment gateway. <br />
```
public function createTransaction($order, $request,$result='pending')
{
      // Logic for creating order transaction based on result
}
```

for testing unit and feature tests. <br />
```
php artisan test
```
